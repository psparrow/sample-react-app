# Sample React App

This sample react app contains an App component and sub-components for rendering a profile photo,
welcome message, and appointment table.

## Running Locally

Clone the repository

	$ git clone git@github.com:psparrow/sample-react-app.git

Enter the app directory

	$ cd sample-react-app

Install the node modules
