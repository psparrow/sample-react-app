# Sample React App

This sample react app contains an App component and sub-components for rendering a profile photo,
welcome message, and appointment table.

The user and appointment data is hardcoded into the main App component. In a real app, it would be replaced
with API calls to the backend server.

## Running Locally

Clone the repository

	$ git clone git@github.com:psparrow/sample-react-app.git

Enter the app directory

	$ cd sample-react-app

Install the node modules

	$ npm install

Start the development server. This should open a local web browser and point you to the application.

	$ npm start

Cheers!
